# About

FourSix is named after a method of brewing coffee called the "4:6 Method" invented by Tetsu Kasuya, former World Brewer's Champion.

> "A new coffee brewing theory created with the concept of 'easily-brewed delicious coffee for everyone.' Divide water into a ratio of 4 to 6. Adjust taste with the first 40% of water and density with the remaining 60%.

> "The point is to use coarse grounds and make the second pour after the water from the first pour completely drips through."
