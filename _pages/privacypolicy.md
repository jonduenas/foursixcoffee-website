## Privacy Policy

FourSix (the "App"), which is owned and developed by Jon Duenas, does not collect any personally identifiable information about any users who install the app. Please don't send me your personal info. I have a hard enough time keeping track of my own.

The App uses Apple as a payment provider for in-app purchases of premium features. Apple's Privacy Policy can be found at [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

The App uses RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases. RevenueCat's Privacy Policy can be found at [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

RevenueCat assigns a random anonymous user identifier (the "User ID") to your device and is sent to their servers for the purpose of managing access to paid features of the App and to facilitate restoring of past purchases on previous installs or devices. No personally identifiable information is included. This User ID may be synced to your other devices via iCloud.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact me at [jon@foursixcoffeeapp.com](mailto:jon@foursixcoffeeapp.com).
